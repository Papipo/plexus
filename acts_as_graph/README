= acts_as_graph

A Plugin to use GRATR in rails. Written by Rick Bradley.

'dag' is an acronym for Directed Acyclic Graph. An intersect table in a database
is a graph structure. One of the more useful ones is a directed acyclic graph, or
more simply a tree with the additional ability for children to have multiple parents.
A concrete example is that of an organization chart. These are usually modelled
as a tree, but this fails the moment an employee splits his work between two
supervisors. An organization chart is more appropriately modeled as a DAG.

== This now works fully integrated with the GRATR library for graph algorithms

Requires the GRATR library to be installed.
